<h2>Scurvy Rush!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Using the flood game, I added new assets and music.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Updating the current assets was very difficult. Learning how to use photoshop and finding images with transparents backgrounds were the most challenging part.
<br>Adding music and changing the volume was frustrating as well. Not being taught anything has been the biggest challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I mainly focused on assets and music this time around. As I have done very little or a very poor job of it last few games.
<br>Finding images and editing the current template was a challenge. Having no knowledge of javascript, phaser, and photoshop was the most difficult part.
<br>Thankfully, I have enough practice on adding the assets correctly.
</li>
