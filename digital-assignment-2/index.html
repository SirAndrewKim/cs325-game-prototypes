<h2>Find Paradise!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The original game just had you remove boxes on a basic background. I added a more specific time <br>
and replaced the images, and added a reset mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I still am learning JS and phaser. So this is an extremely confusing task. The resetting mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Clicking events. The hardest part was getting the reset to work. The easiest was changing the assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oasis image: <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-the-importance-of-oasis-in-a-desert.html"> Background </a></li>
<li>Coconut image: <a href="http://www.pngall.com/coconut-png"> Coconut </a></li> 
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/events/listen-to-game-object-event
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Crush the coconuts to reach the oasis!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Oasis and complete in 20 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse/Clickable buttons/keyboard, a lot of randomness, Competitor/Joker, puzzle(kind of).
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Clickable events
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Hand cramps and trying to reach the oasis within the allocated time.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
LEFT Click on the coconut images, which reveal the background. Have to click through all of them to complete the game. <br>
Press SPACE to reset the game when you reach the end. (Currently bugged! Will have to return to fix).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Using two fingers on the left mouse button will ensure victory!
<br> I would also only press space if you reach 0, otherwise, restarting the browser will reset the game better.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are stuck in a desert. But you come accross and oasis in the distance. However, a swarm of coconut block your way. <br>
Crush the coconuts to reach fresh water and the refreshing shade!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone looking to kill 20 seconds of their time to play test!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
20 seconds
</li>
