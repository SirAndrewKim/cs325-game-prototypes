<h2>Be Strong For Mother</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The original concept of the game is a single player platformer, but I added a 2nd player element to it, there is a cube roaming around the map following the cursor. 
<br>The 2nd player has to click on the cursor to shake the screen, adding a layer of difficulty.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Having a object follow the cursor.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The built in physics for Phaser is very finicky. A small decimal value change created an extremely large change.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used all the assets from myfirstgame example and changed the background to a silly meme.

<li>Star image: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/phaser3-tutorial-src.zip">star</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used the overall code from myfirstgame found here: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/category/games/firstgame">myfirstgame</a>.
I also used some of the code from Digital Assignment 0, specifically the mouse tracking function. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect as many stars possible!
</li>

<li><strong>Challenge:</strong>
Two players, but locally only.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard and moust input. Randomness from how the cube, stars, and bombs move.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A platformer with a collect-a-thon.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Frustration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player 1 moves the character using the left and right keys, which allows the character to move left and right respectively.
<br>Player 2 moves using the mouse. They must left click on the cube, which then shakes the entire screen, making it difficult for player 1 to focus.
<br>Player 1 needs to collect as many stars before they get hit by a bomb.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Player 1 needs to focus on finding the fastest way to the upper platforms, as they have more stars spawned towards the top.
<br>Player 2 needs to find a steady rhythm to be able to click on the cube quickly and frequently to confuse player 1.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is a very simple game with no overall meaning. Just a test on javascript and phaser.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A fun time killer for younger siblings.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1~5 minutes long.
</li>
